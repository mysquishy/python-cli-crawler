# Python CLI Project Comprehensive Guide

## Overview
This project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Python designed to perform crawling operations and process data via a flexible, plugin-based architecture. It enables users to execute crawling tasks, process and summarize textual content, analyze images, and more through modular plugins.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd python_cli_project
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install the Project:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage
Run the CLI project with the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
For additional command-line options, use:
```bash
python main.py --help
```
Refer to the inline documentation in the source code for further details on available commands and options.

## Plugin System
The project utilizes a plugin architecture to extend its functionality. Plugins are stored in the `plugin_extensions/` directory.

### Available Plugins
- **Advanced Content Summarizer:** Provides enhanced summarization of textual content. (`advanced_content_summarizer.py`)
- **Configurable Plugin:** A template for creating plugins with customizable settings. (`configurable_plugin.py`)
- **Content Categorizer:** Categorizes and organizes content into defined categories. (`content_categorizer.py`)
- **Content Enricher:** Enriches content with additional metadata. (`content_enricher.py`)
- **Enhanced Visual Analyzer:** Offers improved analysis for image and visual content. (`enhanced_visual_analyzer.py`)
- **Entity Recognizer:** Detects and extracts entities from text. (`entity_recognizer.py`)
- **Heading Extractor:** Extracts headings from documents. (`heading_extractor.py`)
- **Image Extractor:** Extracts image data from content. (`image_extractor.py`)
- **Keyword Extractor:** Identifies key terms within text. (`keyword_extractor.py`)
- **Sentiment Analyzer & Sentiment Enhanced Summarizer:** Analyzes sentiment and offers enhanced summary features. (`sentiment_analyzer.py` and `sentiment_enhanced_summarizer.py`)
- **Text Summarizer:** Summarizes textual content. (`text_summarizer.py`)
- **Topic Modeler:** Models topics based on the content. (`topic_modeler.py`)
- **Visual Analyzer:** Analyzes visual elements in the content. (`visual_analyzer.py`)

### Adding New Plugins
To add a new plugin:
1. Create a new Python file in the `plugin_extensions/` directory following the structure of existing plugins.
2. Update the `plugin_config.json` if necessary to register the plugin.
3. Use `plugin_reloader.py` to dynamically reload plugins without restarting the application.

## Testing
The project includes both unit tests and integration tests.

### Test Files
- **Unit Tests:** Files such as `test_crawler.py`, `test_plugin_manager.py`, `test_text_summarizer.py`, etc.
- **Integration Tests:** Files like `integration_test.py`, `plugin_integration_test.py`, `integration_plugin_lifecycle_test.py`, and `integration_full_plugin_lifecycle_test.py`.

### Running the Tests
You can run tests using:
```bash
pytest
```
or
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## Continuous Integration
A GitHub Actions workflow is set up in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to automate testing and building on each push to the repository.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. To contribute:
- Fork the repository.
- Create a feature branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/my-feature
  ```
- Commit your changes using clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Open a pull request for review.

## License
The license information can be found in the `setup.py` file or the licensed document provided with the project. Please review these files for any usage or distribution requirements.

## Additional Information
- **Plugin Reloader:** Use `plugin_reloader.py` to reload plugins dynamically during development.
- **Configuration:** Plugin settings and other configurations are maintained in `plugin_config.json`.
- **Documentation:** For further details, refer to inline comments in the source code and the test files which serve as practical examples of project functionality.

Happy Crawling!
